This repository contains pure-python implementation for essential robotics algorithms.

The main benefits are:
1. Have a single source of truth of various algorithms with clear explanation.
2. Implemented with clear separation between dynamics, environment and algorithm, emphasizing that a lot of algorithms, e.g planing under uncertainties, optimal control, share the same underlying problem formulationï¼Œeg. MDP.

## Scope

It should include popular and representative algorithms from robot dynamics, state estimation, planning, control and
learning.

## How to use

- Run `pip install -e .`
- Run various scripts inside examples folder.
